# FreeBillingProgram

About: This was another final project that I got a perfect score on (a good way to make up for any lousy test scores!).  Written in VB using Visual Studio IDE.

Features: The use cases this program features are creating new customers, creating new business services (Utility business services is just used as a the demo, but it can be any business service), creating a bill associated with that customer and business service, exporting invoices (although not anything nicely formatted), and also update and manage payments all with error checking. AND BUG FREE!!!

To Run: Download the repo, open the "Free Billing Program-master" folder and double-click a file named DEMO-GimmieMyMoneyUtilities.exe to open the Utility Company billing demo.

How to Use:  To create a Bill, you need to create a service and a customer and associate their ID's. To create a payment, you need to associate it with a bill ID.  Mind you, since this program isn't connected to a database, there isn't any long-term data storage.  However, one can circumvent this by using the export and import file options to obtain long-term storage. (You create users, services, bills, and payment data, then EXPORT the file.  And when you open the program again later, you can simply IMPORT that file to obtain all previous data.)  The Summary and transaction tabs are a nice way to view what's currently in the system.

How to Improve: You tell me! At first glance a more walkthrough business generating system would be nice (asks the new user what fields they want for their business service tab, their customer tab, bill tabs etc.,)  I do not know how to make money off this program to sell as an app.  Feel free to branch off and play with it!
